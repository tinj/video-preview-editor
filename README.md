Video Preview Generator
====================

**Video Preview Generator **

 

**Overview**

 

VPG is a compact, standalone module which allows
for the seamless and simple creation of a custom video preview.  It will
generate an array of images to represent a video and permits simple editing of
that array.  By default, the array will display every twentieth image, and
the user can easily swap one image out for another.  

 

It’s great for using in:

 

Presentations: 
Show the titles that capture the message of each section

Film summarizing:  Show the action shots that are likely to
capture viewers’ interests

 

 

The exported array will contain images that
accurately convey important highlights in a presentation.  You’ll first
see the default array that shows every twentieth image of the full array.

 

 

This array is scrollable…

 

… and when you click on an image a second array
appears:

 

 

 

This second array shows the images surrounding
the selected frame in the _original full
array of images. _You can then double click on the image you want to use as
the replacement, and it will replace the old image.

Delete
images from your preview array without replacing them

·      
Add
timestamps to images in your final array

·      
Export
new array to clipboard with button

·
